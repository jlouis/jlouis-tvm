%% This file is my default inclusion of packages I need when writing
%% things in LaTeX. The list here is pretty comprehensive, but sets up
%% the main stuff I use in all projects I start on.

%% This part sets up the font basics. I like mathpazo a lot. It sets
%% up Palatino as a clone with pazo math. It is much more beautiful
%% than many other fonts you can choose from. I also like some of the
%% mathdesign variants, in particular [utopia,osf]{mathdesign} with no
%% linespread. We could make it a setting here.
%%
%% Also, add microtype. We can't really live without it.
\usepackage{microtype}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{lmodern}
%\usepackage[osf]{mathpazo}
%\linespread{1.05}
%\usepackage[sc,osf,utopia]{mathdesign}

%% AMS gives us the basic math-support
\usepackage{amsmath}

%% AMS Theorem support. We set up a good list of theorems and make
%% sure that they are numbered appropriately in the order of main
%% theorems. I hate when a document contains too many counters so this
%% keeps the number of live counters down to a minimum.
