>>> NOTE
We stratify into 'reg' and 'exp' respectively to eliminate arbitrarily
nested expression trees. In the LLVM IR we only have primitive operations
and [constant expressions] which are expression trees that can be constant
folded. They are omitted for now, and possibly forever because they don't
provide anything interesting in my humble opinion.

I think they were added as a convenience so one can do e.g. address
calculations on a load word instruction.

%%%%%{ Instruction syntax }%%%%%

%{

We have supposed assignment instructions are of the form

%x = exp

so a series of assignment instructions are of the form

%x1 = exp1;
%x2 = exp2;
...
%xn = expn;

Note that we use an SSA-form. This means that an assignment to x1 is
static. In other words, once x1 is assigned to in the first line, it
is impossible to reassign another value to x1. This effectively makes
x1 a constant in the following evaluation.

As an example, suppose we have the following code segment:

%x1 = 3;
%x2 = 7;
return %x1 + %x2;

This can be transformed into a functionally styled program as

let x1 = 3 in
  let x2 = 7 in
    return x1 + x2;

Which we can then transform to an equivalent program by using
lambda-abstractions for the let-body:

let 3 in
  (fn x1 => let 7 in
    (fn x2 => return x1 + x2))

The latter style is amenable to a HOAS Twelf encoding as follows. We will
define the basic operations of the language as being 'instruction's.

}%

instruction : type. %name instruction I i.

instruction/let : exp -> (reg -> instruction) -> instruction.
instruction/return : reg -> instruction.
instruction/br : label -> reg-list -> instruction.
instruction/brc : reg -> label -> reg-list -> label -> reg-list -> instruction. % Conditional branch

%abbrev let = instruction/let.
%abbrev return = instruction/return.
%abbrev br = instruction/br.
%abbrev brc = instruction/brc.



%%%%%{ Basic Block Syntax }%%%%%

%{

Basic blocks are defined by a label and then a possible list of
phi-nodes. These resemble the let-construction in instructions, but
we can handle them more easily by building them into basic-blocks.

>>> NOTE
This also enforces phi-nodes to be the first thing in basic blocks by
construction
<<<

We thus set out to define basic-block headers:

}%

bb-header : type. %name bb-header BBH bbh.

bb-header/phi : (reg -> bb-header) -> bb-header.
bb-header/body : instruction -> bb-header.

%abbrev phi = bb-header/phi.
%abbrev body = bb-header/body.

%{

A basic block (bb) defines a label, identifying the basic block and
then it contains a bb-header. We have already introduced the bb type family in the
section on maps earlier en vm.elf.

}%

bb : type. %name bb BB.

bb/def : label -> bb-header -> bb.


%{

Here is the notational idea. A set of LLVM instructions of the form

foo:
  %p1 = phi(..,..)
  %x1 = 3;
  %x2 = %p1;
  return %x1 + %x2;

is then translated into

(bb foo (phi [p1]
	     (body
		(let 3 in
		   ([x1] let p1 in
		      ([x2] let (plus [x1] [x2])
			 [tmp] return tmp))))

Where foo is a valid label name.

}%



%{

We will need lists of basic blocks. Note that if we
have the code:

label1:
  ...
  <no jump or return here>
label2:
  ...

we can always fix it by an explicit jump just before label2. Thus, it
seems ok to define lists of basic blocks as a primitive for functions.

}%


bb-list : type.

bb-list/nil : bb-list.
bb-list/cons : label -> bb -> bb-list -> bb-list.




%%%%%{ Function Syntax }%%%%%


%{

The function body itself designates one basic block as the initial block by
its label. This is the block we run when asked.

}%

function-body : type.

function-body/def : label -> bb-list -> function-body.
