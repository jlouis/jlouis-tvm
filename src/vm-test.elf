The following encodes a slightly altered version of Appels
example in the [SSA is Functional Programming] paper. The
changes ensures there are no dead basic blocks and it fixes
a typo.

We also lowered to number of rounds on the while loop; it
proves no point to keep iterating but to stress Twelfs (prolog)
evaluator.

The code is from the [Appel-SSA] paper. It is the 'dumb' version,
where each variable is explicitly passed on.
