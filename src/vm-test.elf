The following encodes a slightly altered version of Appels
example in the [SSA is Functional Programming] paper. The
changes ensures there are no dead basic blocks and it fixes
a typo.

We also lowered to number of rounds on the while loop; it
proves no point to keep iterating but to stress Twelfs (prolog)
evaluator.

The code is transscribed from AppelTest.sml, an implementation
of the functional code in Standard ML.
