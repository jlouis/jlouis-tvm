## TODO list for this project.

* Redefine the current semantics to match what I and Andrzej talked about
** Add the Do-instruction
** Redefine the call to be an instruction rather than an operation.
* Implement brc, conditional branching.
  Easy, just step to the br instruction.
* Consider renaming things to match LLVM more.
* Implement the "Missing" operations for the Appel Example.
* Try to define the Appel Example in our new language.
  This is the check for if it is correct.

* Define a new version of the natural number addition.
  This version should be more binary in its version.

* Define function call semantics for the language.
